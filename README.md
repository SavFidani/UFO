## Purpose: A UFO Sightings Summary
The purpose of this analysis is to provide an efficient and appealing one stop shop that summarizes cases of UFO sightings in a clear and concise table format for consumers.

## Guidelines
### To Filter...
Upon visiting the webpage, you will find a search engine at the bottom left, which will apply filters to our table generating the desired data results.

### Results...
Results based on the filters used will be generated in the table to the right of your search engine for applying filters.

## Drawback
There are no resources included in the web page to gain further details on a sighting that may be of key interest. The user has to then conduct additional research, independent of the web page, if they wish to learn more.

## Recommendations

### #1: Additional Resources
Building off of the above mentioned drawback, it may prove to be useful if a column could be added to the table to provide a link with additional details for each of the sightings. This makes our webpage even more useful in that it not only summarizes UFO sighting details, but also then acts as a direct source for further data on these sightings.

### #2: UFO Sighting Qualifications
While the introduction text on the webpage is useful, it may be beneficial to add another body portion to our text that outlines what qualifies as a UFO sighting, so that readers understand how the data in the table was collected. By inserting a new <title> and <body> portion to our code, we can give consumers an all encompassing understanding of the discussion of our UFO sightings.
